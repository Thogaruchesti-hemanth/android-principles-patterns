## 🤔 What is YAGNI?

### 🧑‍🎓 Simple Explanation:
**YAGNI** stands for **“You Aren’t Gonna Need It”**. It means:
> *Don't write code for a feature until it's actually required.*

Avoid building features just because you "might" need them later. Focus on **what is needed now**, not what you think *might* be needed in the future.

### 💼 Technical Definition:
**YAGNI** is a principle of **extreme programming (XP)** that states:
> *“Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.”*

## 📱 Why YAGNI Matters in Android Development

### 🚫 Overengineering Hurts:
- ❌ **Wasted time** writing unused features or utilities.
- ❌ **Complex codebase** that’s harder to maintain or onboard.
- ❌ **Longer deadlines**, missed milestones.
- ❌ **Harder testing**, more bugs, more dead code.

### ✅ Android-Specific Examples:
| Example | YAGNI Violation |
|--------|------------------|
| Writing a **network layer** in a simple offline-only app | ❌ |
| Adding a **multi-user login system** in a personal note app | ❌ |
| Creating **abstract ViewModel classes** before you even have multiple screens | ❌ |
| Adding a “share feature” button before the MVP is usable | ❌ |

## 🏠 Real-Life Analogy

> 🎒 **Packing for a trip**:  
Don’t pack a winter jacket for a summer beach trip “just in case”. It adds weight and clutter you don’t need.

> 🏗️ **Building a house**:  
Would you build 5 extra rooms just because you *might* have guests one day? Probably not. Build what you need **now** — expand **only if required**.

## 💻 Android Code Example

### ❌ **Bad Practice – YAGNI Violation**

```kotlin
// ViewModel with future "sharePost" feature not needed in current app version
class PostViewModel : ViewModel() {

    val posts = MutableLiveData<List<Post>>()

    fun loadPosts() {
        // Actual requirement
    }

    // YAGNI Violation – Unused feature
    fun sharePost(post: Post) {
        // Not needed now; feature not in scope yet
    }
}
````

### ✅ **Good Practice – YAGNI Applied**

```kotlin
class PostViewModel : ViewModel() {

    val posts = MutableLiveData<List<Post>>()

    fun loadPosts() {
        // Implement only what's currently needed
    }

    // No unnecessary "future feature" code here
}
```

📝 *Keep it lean. Add `sharePost()` only when it's part of the product requirement.*

---

## ✅ Best Practices to Follow YAGNI

* ✅ Code only what's required for the current feature or user story
* ✅ Focus on Minimal Viable Product (MVP) first
* ✅ Use TODOs or comments to **note future ideas**, but don't build them
* ✅ Write testable, extendable code — but **don't abstract too early**
* ✅ Use version control (Git) to iterate when the feature *is* needed

---

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

* ❌ Unused utility/helper classes
* ❌ Config flags for features that don’t exist
* ❌ Over-abstracted base classes or interfaces
* ❌ “Just in case” UI buttons or menu items
* ❌ Database tables or fields with no real use yet

---

## ⏰ When to Apply YAGNI

* ✅ During **early-stage** development
* ✅ While building MVPs or prototypes
* ✅ When time or team resources are limited
* ✅ When requirements are evolving or uncertain

### 🤝 Balance Tip:

> YAGNI doesn't mean *never plan*.
> It means **don’t implement until needed**. Plan smart, but **code lean**.

## 🆚 YAGNI: Bad vs Good (Comparison Table)

| Aspect          | ❌ YAGNI Violation                        | ✅ YAGNI Applied           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ViewModel       | Future methods not in use                | Only current logic        |
| UI              | Placeholder buttons for unbuilt features | No unnecessary UI         |
| Architecture    | Base classes with no real benefit        | Keep it flat and relevant |
| Time Management | Delayed delivery                         | Fast iterations           |
| Code Complexity | Unused abstractions                      | Clean and simple          |
