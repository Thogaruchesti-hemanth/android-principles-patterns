# 📐 Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in Android Development

## 🧠 What is the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)?

The **Open/Closed Principle** is the **O** in **SOLID** — a set of five principles that help you write clean and maintainable object-oriented code.

> 💡 **Definition (Simple):**  
> Your code should be **open for extension**, but **closed for modification**.

This means you should be able to **add new features or behavior** without changing existing code. Instead of modifying existing classes, you extend them.

> 💬 **Technical Definition:**  
> *Software entities (like classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.* — Bertrand Meyer

## 📱 Why is OCP Important in Android Development?

In Android, features evolve constantly. If you modify existing code every time a new feature is added, it:
- Increases bugs
- Breaks existing logic
- Makes testing and maintenance hard

✅ **OCP allows:**
- Adding new features **without breaking old ones**
- Easy plugin of new modules (e.g., new UseCases, payment methods, themes)
- Cleaner MVVM + Repository structure
- Maintainable Clean Architecture

### 🔍 Real Android Examples:
- Adding a **new payment method** in an e-commerce app → extend the strategy, don’t touch existing logic
- Creating **custom UI themes** → extend styles, avoid rewriting activity code
- Adding **different login methods** → extend `LoginStrategy`, don't edit `AuthManager`

## 🔧 Real-Life Analogy

> 🔌 Think of a **power socket with extension ports**.

The socket (your core class) is **closed for modification** — you don’t rewire your wall every time you want more devices plugged in.

Instead, you use an **extension board** (subclass/strategy) — it's **open for extension**, letting you add new devices without changing the original setup.

## 💻 Android Code Example

### ❌ Bad Practice – Violates OCP (Modifies existing class)
```kotlin
// BAD: Adding new types requires modifying this method every time
class NotificationSender {
    fun send(type: String, message: String) {
        when (type) {
            "email" -> sendEmail(message)
            "sms" -> sendSMS(message)
            "push" -> sendPush(message)
        }
    }

    private fun sendEmail(msg: String) { /*...*/ }
    private fun sendSMS(msg: String) { /*...*/ }
    private fun sendPush(msg: String) { /*...*/ }
}
````

### ✅ Good Practice – Follows OCP (Extends behavior)

```kotlin
// Interface for notification strategy
interface NotificationStrategy {
    fun send(message: String)
}

// Different strategies
class EmailNotification : NotificationStrategy {
    override fun send(message: String) { /* send email */ }
}

class SMSNotification : NotificationStrategy {
    override fun send(message: String) { /* send SMS */ }
}

class PushNotification : NotificationStrategy {
    override fun send(message: String) { /* send push */ }
}

// Notification Sender uses abstraction
class NotificationSender(private val strategy: NotificationStrategy) {
    fun send(message: String) {
        strategy.send(message)
    }
}
```

🧪 Now if you want to add WhatsApp notifications, just create `WhatsAppNotification : NotificationStrategy` — no modification needed.

## 🚀 Best Practices

✅ **Tips to Apply OCP in Android:**

* Use **interfaces** to define behaviors
* Use **abstract classes** for base functionality
* Apply **Strategy Pattern** for business logic (e.g., filters, payments, notifications)
* Use **ViewModel extension functions** instead of modifying core ViewModel
* Add new features via **sealed classes** or **plugins**

🚫 **Common Mistakes:**

* Using too many `if-else` or `when` blocks
* Tightly coupling classes with specific behavior
* Changing shared code for small new features

---

## ⏱️ When to Use It

Apply OCP when:

* Adding new business rules (e.g., discount types, login strategies)
* Extending behavior in **UseCases**, **Repositories**, **ViewModels**
* Introducing plugin-based or modular features

## 📊 Visual Summary

| ❌ Bad OCP                                     | ✅ Good OCP                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Uses `if-else` or `when` for behavior         | Uses interfaces or abstract classes         |
| Modifies existing class when adding a feature | Extends class or creates new implementation |
| Risk of bugs and regression                   | Safe and isolated changes                   |
| Hard to test                                  | Easier to test via dependency injection     |
