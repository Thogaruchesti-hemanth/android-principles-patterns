# 📌 High Cohesion & Low Coupling in Android Development

**Keywords:** Android Development, Clean Code, SOLID Principles, Modular Architecture, Low Coupling High Cohesion

## 🧠 What is High Cohesion & Low Coupling?

### 🔹 High Cohesion
- High cohesion means a class or module **does one well-defined job** and all its parts are closely related.
- **The more focused a class is, the higher its cohesion.**

### 🔹 Low Coupling
- Low coupling means **minimal dependency** between classes or modules.
- Changes in one class **should not break or affect** other unrelated classes.

> ✅ **Goal**: Classes should be **internally strong (cohesive)** and **externally independent (loosely coupled)**.

---

## 🚀 Why is It Important in Android Development?

Poor cohesion and high coupling often lead to:
- **Tightly bound Activities** doing too much (UI, logic, API calls)
- Difficult-to-test ViewModels or Repositories
- Hard-to-maintain legacy code

### 🔧 Android-Specific Benefits:
- **Activities/Fragments** focus on UI only (high cohesion)
- **ViewModels** manage UI-related logic only (cohesion)
- **Repositories** fetch data from DB or network (cohesion)
- Layers communicate via **interfaces** (low coupling)
- Enables **modularization** and **clean architecture**

## 🏡 Real-Life Analogy

### 🧑‍🍳 Kitchen Team Analogy:

Imagine a restaurant kitchen:
- The **Chef** cooks (focused role = high cohesion)
- The **Waiter** serves (focused role = high cohesion)
- The **Chef** doesn’t know how the Waiter takes orders (low coupling)

> ✅ Each person does their job independently but collaborates through clear boundaries (like interfaces).

## 📱 Android Code Example

### ❌ Bad Practice – Low Cohesion & High Coupling

```java
// BAD: Activity doing everything (UI + logic + API)
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    void onCreate() {
        fetchUserFromApi(); // business logic here = low cohesion
    }

    void fetchUserFromApi() {
        // Retrofit call directly inside UI layer = high coupling
    }
}
````

### ✅ Good Practice – High Cohesion & Low Coupling

```java
// GOOD: Separation with cohesion + loose coupling

// Activity: Only handles UI
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    UserViewModel viewModel;

    void onCreate() {
        viewModel.getUser().observe(this, user -> {
            // Update UI only
        });
    }
}

// ViewModel: Handles logic
public class UserViewModel extends ViewModel {
    UserRepository repo;

    LiveData<User> getUser() {
        return repo.fetchUser();
    }
}

// Repository: Fetches data
public class UserRepository {
    ApiService api;

    LiveData<User> fetchUser() {
        return api.getUserData();
    }
}
```

✅ Each class is focused (cohesion) and interacts via interfaces (low coupling).

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:

* Use **MVVM architecture** to separate UI, logic, and data
* Follow **Single Responsibility Principle**
* Use **interfaces** between layers (View ↔ ViewModel, ViewModel ↔ Repository)
* Keep **modular structure** (feature-wise or layer-wise)
* Group related logic into **cohesive classes or modules**

### ❌ Avoid This:

* Putting **UI + logic + networking** in a single class
* Making **Activities/Fragments** handle everything
* Creating classes that depend on many unrelated components
* Overusing static classes or tight singleton dependencies

---

## 📍 When to Use It

Focus on **high cohesion & low coupling** during:

* Initial app architecture design
* Building **feature modules**
* Setting up ViewModel, Repository, UseCase layers
* Writing code for shared components (e.g., network, database)

> 🧪 Especially useful when aiming for **testable, maintainable, and scalable apps**.

## 🧾 Summary Table

| ❌ Bad Design                          | ✅ Good Design                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| One class does UI, logic, API calls   | UI, logic, and data layers separated |
| Classes depend directly on each other | Classes communicate via interfaces   |
| Difficult to test and scale           | Easy to test, extend, and refactor   |
| Any change breaks multiple classes    | Changes are isolated and safer       |
